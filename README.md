Description
-----------

This project contains files for a Chrome browser extension that allows
you to highlight any text on a web page and search the ESV bible for that
text. Highlight, right-click and select the search menu item to open a new
tab with the search results, or bible passage.

This is particularly handy when reading blogs, papers, or web sites that
simply list bible references as part of the text.

Installation
------------

 * Clone the repo on the same machine you are running Chrome.
 * Find the Settings page for Chrome.
 * Find the Extensions section of Settings.
 * Above the list of installed extensions, click the button called "Load
   unpacked extension...
 * Select the directory in the repo that contains the manifest.json file and
   load. You should immediately be able to right click on some text and find
   the search menu item.
